## You are a miner stuck in a mine deep undergroud, and you must use the arrow keys to find your way out.
### You gotta collect all the treasure before you get collected by what else is in there
###There are all sorts of traps and walls down in this cave.  Can you break through them on your way to freedom?
### Anything can happen. Nothing is as easy as it seems..
